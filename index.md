## About

I live in the United States and I am a tech nerd and geek. People often say I should start a blog
or post tech help and hints. Maybe I will some day.

## Tech

I have been into computers/tech since a very young age. Hopefully, without dating myself, I can say
that I got started on my dad's first computer, which was a Commodore 64. Heck, he even had a modem
(Don't ask me the baud rate, I was very very young). Ever since then, I have been hooked and the rest
is history.

I have work in the profession and I would say that my long term experience had been in mainly middleware,
but I had done some development too. Now, I am heavy in Kubernetes management, Infra as Code and DevOps
(not just tech, but more importantly, culture).

## Cooking

I have gotten into lots of cooking and I would say that the "pandemic" did contribute to this. I try to make
many different types of foods and I am inspired by having people try my food as I hone the craft. I have a
strange nuance though... I don't like eating vegetables in my cooking. This creates a unique challenge with
many foods I make and the easiest way I can describe how I cook is that I make the dish "kid safe".
